								  <p>A quick demonstration going over the main functionality of the website.</p>
								  
							</center> 
							
							 <p style="color:white; font-style: italic;"> A platform where users can register for an account and purchase Apple products in an E-Bay like fashion.
							Users have the option to list their item as a forward/dutch auction (described below). The highest bidder wins (earliest "bidder" in case of a dutch auction) and is 
						then able to click the button which takes the user to the payment page and is asked for thier payment information. The website has a sleek modern look which is intuitive as well as fun to interact with. </p>

						 <p style="color: white; font-size: xx-large; margin:3px; font-weight: bold;"> A little about this project</p>

						  <p style="color: white;"> In a team of 3, we worked to create a functional E-commerce platform focused on Apple products.<br><br>

							We employed Java with Spring Boot for the backend functionality of the website and established a SPRING MVC architecture for efficient communication between the platform’s elements. Lastly, our data management relied on SQLite, a reliable and straightforward database management system.<br><br>
							
							For the frontend, we utilized Thymeleaf templates which dynamically reference the model in order to populate the HTML pages and used CSS to style these pages, keeping things modern and intuitive. And for testing/demonstration, we streamlined local hosting on Apache Tomcat.<br><br>
							
							A notable highlight of our platform is the integration of a real-time bidding system. By employing web sockets, we engineered a mechanism that provides immediate updates to bidders (as in the current highest bidding price and the username of that highest bidder) in real time. This keeps the bidding process exciting and transparent.<br><br>

						<p style="color: white; font-weight: bolder;"> Methods/Functions </p>
						
						
						<p style="color: white; font-size: large; font-style: italic; margin: 3px; font-weight: bold;">Function 1- Insert</p>

						<p style="color: white">The insert function is used to essentially add the key-value pair into the hashmap. This is done by first checking if the key already exists in the hashmap, because if it does we will 
							have to alert the user and return from the method as each key is supposed to be unique.
							<br/>However, if the key does not exist, we proceed to add it to the hashmap. This is done by adding the key to the supplementary array list. Once it is added to the array list, the index of the key is used as the
							value for this key and this pair is added to the hashmap.
							
							</p>

							<p> <br /> </p>
							<p style="color: white; font-size: large; font-style: italic; margin: 3px; font-weight: bold;">Function 2- Delete</p>


							<p style="color: white">The delete function is used to essentially delete the key-value pair from the hashmap. This is done by first checking if the exists in the hashmap. That is done by extracting the value of the
								 key using a hashmap method and checking if the value is null. If it is, then the key does not exist and therefore there is nothing to delete and the user is alerted subsequently.<br/>
								However, if the key does exist, we proceed to delete it from the hashmap. This process is a little more complicated than inserting. It would be easier to remove an element from the end of an array list rather than 
								the middle which would need it to then rearrange all the rest of the elements so that no value in between the array list is null. And since the order of the keys is not important, what we did is swap the key to remove
								 with the last key in the arraylist. We did this buy extracting the index of the last element of the array list (size of arraylist -1) and then checked to see if this index is also the same as the value of the key, because 
								 if it is that would mean that this key-value pair is the only one in the arraylist(and therefore in the hashmap) and we would not need to do any swapping. However, if it is not, then we extract the current key in the last
								position of the array list to later assign a new value to it. After we do that, we use a java utility function to swap in the array the key in the last position with the key that we have to delete. And once we do that, we 
								remove the key that is now in the last position(this is now the key we want to delete).<br/> 
								Finally, assign the key that was swapped the new value which was previously used byt the key we just removed.
								</p>


								<p> <br /></p>
								<p style="color: white; font-size: large; font-style: italic; margin: 3px; font-weight: bold;">Function 3- Search</p>

								<p style="color: white">The search function is used to essentially search a key-value pair on the hashmap. This is done by first checking if the exists in the hashmap. That is done by extracting the value of the key using
									 a hashmap method and checking if the value is null. If it is, then the key does not exist and therefore it is not found and the user is alerted subsequently.<br/>
									However, if the key does exist, then we print a message to the user that shows the key they searched for and the value of this key. The function then returns this value.
