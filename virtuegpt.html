						<p style="color: white; font-size: xx-large; margin:3px; font-weight: bold;"> How I Developed VirtueGPT.</p>									
							
						<p style="color: white;">Leveraging cutting-edge technologies, 
                            I utilized Python for robust backend logic and processing, while Flask provided the dynamic web framework for seamless interactions. HTML/CSS sculpted the 
                            frontend design, ensuring an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface.

                                <br><br>
                            VirtueGPT's deployment and hosting are powered by Vercel, ensuring efficient access and reliability for users. Integration with OpenAI's advanced LLM-AI responses 
                            infuses the platform with personalized insights and empathetic responses.</p>
